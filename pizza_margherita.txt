My search for the best homemade margherita pizza (made in a standard oven with everyday ingredients) is over! This classic pizza is made with everyday ingredients and topped with a simple fresh pizza sauce made from canned tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and fresh basil. You’ll want to make it over and over again!
If you maintain a sourdough starter, I highly recommend preparing this pizza with sourdough pizza dough! It offers a flavor and texture that cannot be replicated.
