Description
My pizza dough recipe yields about 2 pounds of dough, which is enough for two 12-inch pizzas. Toppings listed below are enough for one 12-inch pineapple & ham pizza. Freeze the rest of the pizza dough for another time, or make two pizzas by doubling the topping ingredients. Feel free to use 1 lb. store-bought pizza dough instead of homemade.

Ingredients
1/2 recipe homemade pizza dough (or 1 lb. store-bought pizza dough)
1 Tablespoon (15ml) olive oil, divided
1 Tablespoon (8g) cornmeal
1/2 cup (127g) pizza sauce (homemade or store-bought)
1 and 1/2 cups (6oz or 168g) shredded mozzarella cheese
1/2 cup (75g) cooked ham or Canadian bacon, sliced or chopped
1/2 cup (82g) pineapple chunks (canned or fresh)
3 slices bacon, cooked and crumbled
